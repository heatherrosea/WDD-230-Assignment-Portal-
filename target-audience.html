    <h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
        <p>The target audience is 25-35 year-old adults who work full-time jobs and have 1-2 children. They have a college education and have an average salary of about $60,000. They live in larger cities around the United States.</p>

    <h3>PERSONA ONE: DAVID</h3>
        <p>David is a 32 year-old male who lives in Seattle. He works in HR at a local tech company. He is married and expecting his first child.</p>
          <h3>SCENARIOS:</h3><p>David has to commute to work and needs to know whether his car will make it on the roads or not due to the weather. <br><br> <strong>Solution: </strong>We offer the most up-to-date forecast for the morning, and we mark if the forecast could indicate dangerous roads.
          <br><br>David's favorite hobby is camping, but he barely has time for it. When he plans a camping trip, he needs to know it will be worth his time.<br><br><strong>Solution: </strong>We provide forecasts for more rural areas and can show as many days ahead as the user needs.</p>

    <h3>PERSONA TWO: JULIE</h3>
      
        <p>Julie is a 28 year-old female who lives in Salt Lake City. She runs her own successful photography business and had her first child six months ago. She took a break from work, but is ready to start booking clients again.</p>
      <h3>SCENARIOS:</h3>
      <p>Julie needs to know if the weather is suitable for an outdoor photograph session. Unexpected bad weather is not an option as it would ruin her shoot.
      <br><br><strong>Solution:</strong> We keep our forecast information updated constantly so there aren't any second guesses.
      <br><br>Julie is a cautious first-time mom and worries about her child in the winter. She needs to know how cold it will get so she can dress her baby appropriately.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> We provide information along with temperature, such as wind chill and estimated snowfall.
      <br><br>Julie often visits family in neighboring cities and wants to easily access between cities.
      <strong>Solution:</strong> We allow users to favorite certain cities or areas and group cities by areas.</p>
